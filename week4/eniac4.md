how many different versions should be tested

what kind of changes can be implemented in each version of the test (from changing just the color of a button to redesigning the whole site)

how can we show one version to a selected group of users and another version to a different group

which metric should we chose to compare the different versions

should eniac experiment with other elements of the site instead of/ additionally to  the 'SHOP NOW' button

how can we track, store, and analyze the data from each version


how can we ever be sure that the version with the best performance is not having more clicks due to just chance

how long can we expect the experiment to last
